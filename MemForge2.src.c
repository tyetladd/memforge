   cache-line interleave (overlapping address ranges across DIMMs) or
   BLOCK mapping (disjoint ranges, each DIMM owns its own physical
   region). PassMark forum & KIT paper both confirm that even though
   the iMC physically interleaves consumer dual-channel at 64-byte
   cache-line granularity, BIOS vendors often emit Type 20 entries in
   BLOCK form (one DIMM per region) — what we see in the field on
   Gigabyte B760M DDR4 (A2=0..8GB, B2=8..16GB, intl depth=2 but ranges
   disjoint). Two interpretations:
     - Real disjoint = independent channels, no interleave → errors
       distributed across DIMMs really are on physically separate sticks.
     - Pseudo-interleave (BIOS lies) = iMC interleaves, but Type 20 hides
       it → errors distributed look like multiple sticks but are one chip.
   Without iMC PCI register access (Intel doesn't document MAD_*
   registers for consumer Alder Lake), we use a heuristic:
     overlap_found == 1 → trust Type 20 reports interleave, multi-DIMM
                          errors → "ONE chip on ONE of pair X/Y"
     overlap_found == 0 + intl_depth_max <= 1 → block mode, multi-DIMM
                          errors → "BOTH sticks have faults"
     overlap_found == 0 + intl_depth_max  > 1 → BIOS conflict, fall back
                          to bit-6 channel polarity analysis to decide.
   Returns 1 if any pair of Type 20 entries has overlapping ranges. */

/* v0.4.27 — Approach A: bit-6 polarity analysis of error addresses.
   On most Intel/AMD consumer dual-channel desktops with DDR4/DDR5, the
   iMC's channel selector is physical address bit 6 (alternating 64-byte
   cache lines between channels). If all error records share the same
   bit-6 value, that's a strong hint the bad cell/chip lives in only ONE
   channel even though Type 20 (block-mapped) may have attributed them
   to multiple DIMM labels. Returns:
      0 = mixed (errors on both bit-6 values, no strong signal)
      1 = all errors at bit 6 == 0 (likely channel A)
      2 = all errors at bit 6 == 1 (likely channel B)
   "All" = ≥85% on one polarity; ≥3 errors required for a verdict
   (single-error noise gives no signal). On chipsets where the channel
   selector isn't bit 6 (Skylake-X page-stride hash, some servers), this
   will return 0 and the caller should fall back to the conservative
   "physical isolation needed" message. */

/* ---------- DRAM coordinate decode (approximate) ----------
   Map a physical address to (channel, bank, row, column) using a *generic*
   DDR4/DDR5 bit layout. We deliberately do NOT try to model the chipset's
   actual hash function — Intel doesn't document it for client SKUs, and
   server SKUs have one model-specific decoder per generation in Linux's
   EDAC drivers. Instead we use the canonical DDR4/DDR5 bit-position
   mapping that most modules follow at the JEDEC level. The result is
   approximate: it will agree with the actual mapping up to per-channel
   interleave hashing (channel guess may be off by 1 on dual-channel,
   bank within bank-group may swap). It IS reliable for:
     - "Are all errors in the SAME row?" — yes/no
     - "Are all errors in the SAME bank?" — yes/no
     - "Cluster of errors around row N" — yes the cluster is real
   …which is exactly what shop diagnostics need. Marked "~" in output so
   the user knows it's a heuristic.

   DDR4 typical (8 GB unbuffered, x8 chips, 17-bit row):
     PA[5:0]   byte within cacheline (fixed, 64-byte access)
     PA[12:6]  column[9:3]    (7 bits used)
     PA[14:13] bank group     (2 bits = 4 groups)
     PA[17:15] bank in group  (3 bits = 8 banks)
     PA[34:18] row            (up to 17 bits)
     PA[6]     channel hash on 2-ch systems (rough)
   DDR5 typical:
     Same basic shape but 4 bank groups × 4 banks/group (8 BG × 4 banks
     for x16 narrow-IO), 16-18 bit row. Layout very similar at this
     coarse level. We use the DDR4 mapping; the labels still cluster

           halt on budget AMD boards:

             Intel: 15M iters × 8 dep chains. Intel HWP throttles
             aggressively per-core; high-end Z-series VRMs handle the
             load; matches Prime95 Small FFT power profile (~150W on
             i7-12700K). Field-tested OK on Z690, Z790, OptiPlex 7060.

             AMD: 5M iters × 4 dep chains, PLUS a 'pause × 4' breather
             every 128K outer iterations. Power profile drops ~70%
             without losing the "sustained AVX2 stress" semantic.
             Reason: AMD Zen has double-pumped AVX2 (256-bit YMM
             dispatched as 2× 128-bit ops), and budget ASUS B-series /
             MSI Pro 4-fase VRMs cannot sustain a Prime95-class
             workload on 12 cores — field-reported halt on Ryzen 5 4500
             + ASUS B-series traces directly to this. With the softer
             load, AMD systems still measurably heat up (good for
             surfacing VRM transients and thermal-margin DRAM faults),

/* Push this core to its maximum P-state (turbo). In UEFI pre-OS there is no
   OS power-management driver, so the firmware leaves the CPU at whatever
   default P-state it set during boot (usually base ratio, sometimes lower).
   With AVX2 stress on 16 idle cores we saw the i5-12600KF top out at 57 W
   and 39 °C — only ~40 % of its 150 W PL2 limit, because the cores never
   asked for turbo. Result: stress tests were "stress" in name only.

   The fix is the standard Intel sequence used by enterprise UEFI apps and
   recommended by Intel community / SDM Vol. 3B:
     1. IA32_MISC_ENABLE (0x1A0) bit 38 = 0   → un-disable turbo
     2. IA32_PM_ENABLE   (0x770) = 1           → enable HWP (write-once / reset)
     3. read IA32_HWP_CAPABILITIES (0x771)[7:0] → "Highest" supported perf level
     4. IA32_HWP_REQUEST (0x774) = min=highest, max=highest, EPP=0 (performance)
   Step 4 demands the PCU run THIS logical CPU at its peak. Each core has
   its own MSR view, so this MUST run on every AP via MP Services, not just
   the BSP — that's why detect_cpu_features() calls it for BSP and ap_entry()
   calls it on each AP.

        (they read back correct data). MCA is the ONLY way to surface

/* ---------- AMD SMN (System Management Network) thermal reader ----------
   AMD Zen+ CPUs expose their Tctl (control temperature, the same value
   shown by Ryzen Master / HWiNFO) via the System Management Network.
   The SMN is reachable from the host CPU through a mailbox in the Data
   Fabric device at PCI 00:00.0 (vendor 0x1022) using a non-standard
   index/data pair in config space:
     - PCI config offset 0x60: SMN target address (write 32-bit)
     - PCI config offset 0x64: SMN data (read 32-bit)
   For Zen / Zen+ / Zen2 / Zen3 / Zen4 the Tctl register is at SMN
   address 0x00059800 ("F17M00H_THM_TCTL" in AMD PPR docs). The value
   read is encoded as:
     bits [31:21]  Tctl temperature in 0.125 °C units
       (i.e. divide by 8 to get °C with quarter-degree precision)
   We sample this periodically from sample_aggregate_metrics on AMD
   systems where SMN responded with non-FF on probe.

   Caveats:
     - This is PER-PACKAGE (socket) temperature, not per-core like Intel
       IA32_THERM_STATUS. We populate g_max_temp_c only — the per-core
       column in the core panel still shows "—" on AMD.
     - On dual-socket AMD systems we only see socket 0. UEFI apps don't
       have a clean way to enumerate sockets without ACPI tables.
     - Some Zen3+ chiplet designs add an offset ("Tctl offset", 27 °C
       for Threadripper, etc.) which is what makes Ryzen Master show a
       different value than HWiNFO. We use the raw Tctl. */

/* ---------- Intel SMBus / SPD reader ----------
   Intel ICH/PCH SMBus host controller lives at PCI device class 0x0C0500
   (Serial Bus → SMBus). Across generations it has appeared at multiple
   bus/dev/func locations but always with that class code, so we scan PCI
   bus 0 for it rather than hard-coding.

   Once found, BAR4 (offset 0x20 in config) holds the I/O base address.
   Standard register layout (Intel SMBus Programmer's Reference):
     +0x00 HST_STS    R/W  Host Status (write-1-to-clear for sticky bits)
     +0x02 HST_CNT    R/W  Host Control (start, command code, intr enable)
     +0x03 HST_CMD    R/W  Command code (the byte-offset INSIDE the SPD EEPROM)
     +0x04 XMIT_SLVA  R/W  Slave 7-bit address + R/W bit
     +0x05 HST_D0     R/W  Data byte 0 (read result lives here for byte ops)
     +0x06 HST_D1     R/W  Data byte 1 (for word ops, unused for SPD byte reads)
   HST_STS bit fields we care about:
     bit 0 HOST_BUSY     — controller is mid-transaction
     bit 1 INTR          — operation completed successfully
     bit 2 DEV_ERR       — device gave NACK (e.g. no SPD at that addr)
     bit 3 BUS_ERR       — generic SMBus error
     bit 4 FAILED        — host abort
   HST_CNT command codes (bits 4:2):
     001 BYTE            — write/read a single byte at HST_D0
     010 BYTE_DATA       — write command byte + write/read HST_D0
     011 WORD_DATA       — like BYTE_DATA but uses both HST_D0/D1
   Plus bit 6 START kicks the transaction. Bit 0 INTR_EN we leave 0
   (poll-based). The slave address byte is (addr_7bit << 1) | (1 = read).

/* ---------- Periodic-wake key wait ----------
   Wait for either a keystroke or a short timer tick. Returns 1 if a key
   was successfully read into *out_key, 0 if it was a timer tick (no key)
   or a spurious wake.

   Why we don't just block on ConIn->WaitForKey:
     Some old HP business EFI firmwares (e.g. Z2 G8, EliteDesk 800 series)
     deactivate USB-keyboard polling after the WaitForEvent has been
     blocked for ~10 s — the USB stack assumes nobody's waiting and stops
     servicing the device. After that, ESC / any key never gets delivered
     and the user has to power-cycle to exit a summary screen.
   Periodic short waits (timeout_ms = 200) force firmware to re-enter
   WaitForEvent often enough that the USB stack keeps polling. The caller
   gets a 0 return when nothing happened and just loops again — totally
   harmless on firmwares that don't need it. */

               is shown in the top-left quadrant (user's "1/4 screen" bug).
             - Firmware-enumerated modes are guaranteed to work — picking
               the max one always fills the physical display.
           Tiny-font concern at 4K is handled by g_font_scale below: when
           the picked resolution is bigger than 1500 px vertical, we render
           the bitmap font at 2× so each character covers 28×56 px instead
           of 14×28 — same visual size as on a 1080p screen.

           jumps to 118°C under load. Real idle temp on that build is
           ~43°C per Windows HWiNFO64 cross-check — meaning the k10temp-
           style decode (raw>>21, /8 = °C) has an undocumented +~50°C
           offset on Ryzen 5 4500 (Renoir desktop) on at least some

           desktop SKUs aren't tabulated, so we (like Linux) assumed
           offset=0. That assumption is wrong for this SKU.

           Since the MSR-bug fix in v0.4.10 (Intel-only IA32_THERM_STATUS
           in ap_yield) was the actual cause of the original hangs, the
           thermal guard logic isn't needed and was misfiring on bogus
           sensor data. Just log the reading informationally and proceed.

           Users with genuinely-overheating systems will still see the
           warning + a moving live-temp log — they can decide whether
           to abort. Users with bogus-sensor systems just get a warning
           they can ignore. No more auto-skip or hard-stop based on
           sensor data we can't trust per-SKU. */
